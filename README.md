# NBA Attendance Analysis

## Matiullah Hasher (matiullah23) and JT von Seggern (Jtvon29)

The goal is to to predict a NBA teams attendance (referred to as capacity %) based on the following three factors: their previous yearâ€™s win-loss record (winning %), the number of all-stars they had the previous season, and the amount they spend on players based on the salary cap. 

We are analyzing data from the point of view of data analysts for NBA teams. 
When mentioning attendance we are referring to home attendance unless otherwise stated. 

Data cleaning was done using Excel and Python (Pandas).
Data analysis and machine learning were done using Python (Numpy and Scikit-Learn ).
Data visualizations were done using Python (Matplotlib), Tableau and Javascript(amcharts).
