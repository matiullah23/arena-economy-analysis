# NBA Attendance Analysis

Attempt to predict teams attendance based on: 
1. Previous season win-loss record. The data for this field is from 2015-2016.
2. Number of All-Stars previous season. The data for this field is from 2015-2016.
3. Total player salary for current season. The data for this field is from 2016-2017.


Most Recent Year of Attendance Data: 2016-2017

## Notes:

-running multiple regression with our 3 variables yielded bad results so next step is do single regression on each variable and take it from there

-all regressions so far have not yielded good results. Somethings to visualize- the team's with 3+ all stars, lets run analysis on their attendance & # all-stars to see how much the increase in all-stars effected those specific teams

-impact of Lebron on attendance. Look at Cavs and Heat during the 9 years of data. 3 seperate analysis: 1 home, 1 road, 1 total

-look into W-L vs All-Stars

-look into impact of All-Stars on opposing teams effecting attendance of teams with low % capacity



-In presentation state data that would have been helpful to have: ticket prices for each team, % of tickets sold in secondary market, avg prices of tickets per team
